# nfsn-api-php

PHP bindings for the NFSN API.

## Installation

You can require it directly with Composer:

```bash
composer require nfsn/apiclient
```

Or download the source from GitHub: https://github.com/nfsn/nfsn-apiclient-php.git

## Requirements

This module requires PHP 8.3 or later.

## Usage

The API documentation is located in the NearlyFreeSpeech.NET member wiki, [here](https://members.nearlyfreespeech.net/wiki/API/Introduction).

## Stability

Prior to refactoring, this client has been widely used by many customers in production for several years. It is not expected to change much in the future. Any significant changes will likely occur in a separate library.

## History

This module was refactored from our internal software library in September 2025.
